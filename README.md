# Bad Bunny Project

This is the code to analyze songs (better if they are from the same artists, they are more homogeneus) and train a model, a ResNet by default, to predict if they will surpass a thrashold of views or not.
<br>
The project has been test with 63 songs of Bad Bunny and setting a threshold of 300.000 views, using these configurations:
 <ol>
    <li>Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz</li>
    <li>Lenght of sample: 15sec</li>
    <li>Number of samples per song: 4</li>
    <li>Model: ResNet</li>
    <li>Number of epochs: 50</li>
  </ol>

The results obtained in the Validation set are shown in this matrix:

Then I tested the model in the Test set, made by
